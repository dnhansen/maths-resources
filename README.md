# maths-resources

This is an attempt to collect notes on mathematics resources I have used and continue to use. It is not meant to be authoritative or exhaustive, but perhaps someone might benefit from my thoughts on the resources below.

## Analysis

## Algebra

## Topology

Point-set (or 'general') topology is relatively self-contained as a discipline, but (for good reason!) it is usually taught after introductory real analysis. Parts of it also depend quite heavily on non-trivial set theory, but most introductory textbooks on topology cover the required amount of set theory quite nicely.

'Nice to know' stuff before learning topology includes some na√Øve set theory, analysis on Euclidean space, metric space topology, and maybe even a slight bit of category theory (though that is certainly not necessary).

General topology is significantly more abstract than metric space topology, so it may be advantageous to brush up on some of that. Good textbooks include:

1. Rudin, *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*. The classical textbook on introductory real analysis, has a nice chapter on metric space topology.
2. Apostol, *Mathematical Analysis*. Another classic analysis text. I personally prefer it to Rudin, but both cover the material nicely.
3. Folland, *Real Analysis*. Has a more cursory coverage of metric spaces, but the proofs are very nice.
4. Sutherland, *Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces*. The first part is on metric spaces, and then he repeats himself in his coverage of topological spaces.

I won't say much more about metric spaces. Onto the main recommendations:
